== How to embed an HTML page?

//Notes: Make sure to set the height large enough to fit full page.

////
You can use the subs attribute to specify a comma-separated list of substitutions.
These substitutions will be applied to the content prior to it being reintroduced to the output document.

== How do document attributes with style?

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Attributes with styles
// Include contents of docinfo.html
// in HTML head with CSS style
// definitions for .label.added,
// .label.changed and .label.updated
// used in the document attributes
// cl-added, cl-changed and cl-updated.
:docinfo1:
// Document attribues with styling,
// using the passthrough macro
// and quotes subsitution.
// We can use quotes or the short-hand q.
:cl-added: pass:quotes[[.label.added]#Added:#]
:cl-changed: pass:q[[.label.changed]#Changed:#]
:cl-updated: pass:q[[.label.updated]#Updated:#]
== Sample section
* {cl-added} Document attributes for document.
* {cl-changed} Definition of attributes to include
 more options.
* {cl-updated} New version of Asciidoctor.
----

Notice we need a file docinfo.html with the CSS style definitions:

.docinfo.html
[source,asciidoc]
----
<style>
.label {
    color: #fff;
    padding: .2em .6em .3em;
    font-weight: 700;
    border-radius: .25em;
    font-size: 90%;
}
.added {background-color: #007700;}
.changed {background-color: #088;}
.updated {background-color: #3344bb;}
</style>

When we run Asciidoctor to get HTML output we see the following:

== Substitute Attribute in Listing Block

To write a listing block where the contents of the block is generated in a monospace font and line breaks are preserved is easy with Asciidoc.
We can use ---- or [listing] or indent the paragraph with one space to define a listing block.
All content in a listing block is processed as is, but special characters and callouts are processed.
This means if we have an attribute in our block the attribute is not substituted with the actual value.
To enable the replacement of the attribute with the attribute value we must set the subs attribute for our listing block.

Suppose we have the following listing block in our documentation with the attribute grailsVersion in the content:

++++
:grailsVersion: 2.3.8

----
$ grails -version
Grails version: {grailsVersion}
----
When we generate HTML output we get the following result:


We add now the subs attribute to our listing:

:grailsVersion: 2.3.8

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ grails -version
Grails version: {grailsVersion}
----
The generated HTML now shows that the attribute value is used:


Alternative ways to define the listing block with the subs attribute. These will render the same result:

[listing,subs="attributes"]
$ grails -version
Grails version: {grailsVersion}

[subs="attributes"]
 $ grails -version
 Grails version: {grailsVersion}
++++
